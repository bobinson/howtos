# swappiness this control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps out anonymous memory relative to pagecache # and other caches. Increasing the value increases the amount of swapping. The default value is 60.

#vfs_cache_pressure this variable controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for

#are reclaimed.
